# What's Solar-Eclipse about?
This program allows us to practice everything we have learned to do with java threads and also to connect our code with interactive graphical interfaces, which we are doing through javaFX framework. This allows us to consolidate the knowledge we have acquired during the course of algorithms and programming 2.
